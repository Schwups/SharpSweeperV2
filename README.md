# SharpSweeperV2
 I got bored and remade SharpSweeper.
 It is still a MineSweeper game written in c# and the ui is basically identical however the code has been rewritten from the ground up.
 Still includes variable difficulties but i didnt bother with the easter eggs this time.
 Also actually automatically clears any tiles near a 0 tile, recursive algorithms are a pain.

 The MineSweeper grid is now actually a grid of tiles instead of the god awful system that used 2 different 2d arrays from SharpSweeper v1.
 Additionally the code is just cleaner overall and dosent include the dumb algorithms that the original does (the AddNumbers() function in v1s Grid class still haunts me).
 Other than that i havent bothered to comment the code but i might at somepoint.

 If for some reason anyone wants to reuse this code just why but feel free.
